// Import the Mongoose connection setup (configured in DBsetup.js)
const mongoose = require("./DBsetup.js");

// Define the User schema to represent a one-to-few relationship
// Each user has a 'username' and an array of 'addresses'
// Addresses are embedded subdocuments containing location and city fields
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  username: {
    type: String,

  addresses: [
    {

/*
  Function: addUsers
  - Purpose: Demonstrates creating a new user with multiple addresses
  - Data Flow:
      1. A new User instance is created with an initial address.
      2. A second address is added to the 'addresses' array using the push method.
      3. The user document is saved to the MongoDB database.
  - Main Concept:
      This is an example of a one-to-few embedded relationship where one user document
      directly contains multiple address subdocuments. This structure is useful when the
      related data (addresses) is not large and is tightly coupled with the parent document.
