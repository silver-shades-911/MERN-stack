// Create a new Person (consumer)

// Create a new Post linked to a Person. 
// Note: In this example, we attempt to add a post for a user with username "Zara". 
// Ensure that a Person with that username exists or adjust the username accordingly.
addPost("Guyys Lookout my new Luxury Hotel", 500600, "Zara");

// Retrieve and display posts with their associated Person data
