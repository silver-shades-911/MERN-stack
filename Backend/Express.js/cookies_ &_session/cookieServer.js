/*  
  ? What Are Cookies?
    Cookies are small pieces of data stored in the user's browser.
    They are sent from the server to the client and stored on the clientâ€™s machine. 
    Each subsequent request from the client will include the cookie data, making cookies useful for:
        - Session management (e.g., login sessions).
        - Personalization (e.g., user preferences).
        - Tracking (e.g., analytics and user behavior).
