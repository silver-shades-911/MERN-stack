  ? What Are Cookies?
    Cookies are small pieces of data stored in the user's browser.
    They are sent from the server to the client and stored on the clientâ€™s machine.
    They help in:
      - Session management (e.g., login sessions).
      - Personalization (e.g., user preferences).
      - Tracking (e.g., analytics and user behavior).

  Route: /random
  Purpose: Send an unsigned cookie to the client's browser.
  How it works:
    - res.cookie() attaches a cookie named "username" with the given value.
    - The cookie will be stored on the client and sent back with subsequent requests.

/*  
  Route: /info
  Purpose: Retrieve and use an unsigned cookie from the request.
  Data Flow:
    - The browser sends the stored cookie in the request.
    - The cookie-parser middleware populates req.cookies.
    - The code extracts "username" from req.cookies and sends it back.

/*  
  Route: /getsignedcookies
  Purpose: Send a signed (encrypted) cookie to the client.
  How it works:
    - Setting {signed: true} tells cookie-parser to sign the cookie.
    - Signed cookies are stored separately in req.signedCookies for verification.

  Route: /verify
  Purpose: Access and display both unsigned and signed cookies.
  Data Flow:
    - req.cookies contains unsigned cookies.
    - req.signedCookies contains signed cookies (after verification).
